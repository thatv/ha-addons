# Yggdrasil Network
An Addon for running A Yggdrasil node for Homeassistant. It provides a persistant IP and local discovery. 

For more info  visit https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/

No configuration options for distant peers for now, but maybe future-me will fix that.

## Install 

Just install the addon and grap the yggdrasil-ip form the log, local peering should work
